### Absract:

Our project seeks to analyze electric vehicle (EV) data obtained from the official US government website, with a particular emphasis on data sourced from the State of Washington. Our primary objectives include examining the geographical distribution of EVs, identifying the most prominent car brands in the EV market, and pinpointing the cities where EV adoption is most prevalent.

Furthermore, we aim to explore correlations between EV adoption rates and various socio-economic factors such as population density, educational attainment, and employment rates.

By investigating these hypotheses, we hope to gain insights into the factors influencing EV popularity and the potential interplay between EV adoption and demographic trends.

### Hypotheses:

1. Counties in WA State that have higher average population density between 2000 to 2023, have higher EVs.
2. In WA Counties, education rate is directly proportional to EV adoption rate.
3. In the State of WA, (Hispanic) race is more likely to purchase an Ev than other races.
4. Occupation/Salaries
